`Principles?
Object Oriented Languages promote: modularity & code reusability
There is not a specification or technical document for OOP
It's based from common sense from papers of aerly reseachers`

`Two accepted definitins: for define a programming as OO`
`Capability to model problems through objects`
`Support few principles to grant modularity and code reuse`

`1st requirement:
Model through Objects: describe reality using object and its relationships`
`- Association
    Object capability to refer another object`
`- Aggregation
    object capability to refer one or more independent objects`
`- Composition
    object capability to refer one or more dependent objects`

`2nd requirement
OO principles: grant modularity & code reuse`
`- Encapsulation
    capability to concentrate into a single entity data and code that manipulates it. hidden internal datails`
`- Inheritance
    mechanism by which object acquires some or all features of one or more objects`
`- Polymorphism
    capability to process objects differently based on their data type or structure`

`OOP Language: typically these requirements classify a language as OO`
